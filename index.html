    <p>Krazy Korn started as a family made popcorn company. Rosemary and Frank Wills started the company back in the 1980s and it’s been a hit ever since. They wanted a way to make popcorn fun and exciting for everyone to enjoy and it definitely is! They have three fantastic flavors of: buttered, kettle and cheese all made of natural home-grown ingredients!</p>

    <p>The Wills family has continued to produce this fantasticly delicious popcorn for many years, all while sticking to the original recipe and honoring the founders wishes. Krazy Korn is produced out of Western Massachusetts and is sold at local grocery stores and farmer’s markets across the state, year round! No one knows what makes this popcorn so special, but the corn is organically grown and dried naturally!</p>
